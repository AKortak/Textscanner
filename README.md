# Mobile Textrecognition

This is a OCR application based on the cross-platform-framework Flutter, which is used to automaticly recognize and identify characters in a given picture.
The recognized text is then saved locally via sqflite and also stored in a Firestore database, which can be accessed by a Firebase login server.
The text recognition itself is realised with FirebaseML.
